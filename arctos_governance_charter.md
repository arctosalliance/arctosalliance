# Arctos Alliance – Governance Charter (Draft)

## 1. Governing Board

**Composition**  
- Seats allocated to major financial sponsors (one seat per sponsoring organization).  
- Optional independent/community seats may be added to ensure balance.  
- Members serve renewable terms of 1–2 years.  

**Responsibilities**  
- Approve budgets and oversee financial stewardship (administered through OSC).  
- Set funding allocations (e.g., number of funded fellows, infrastructure, events).  
- Provide strategic input on ecosystem needs and sponsor priorities.  
- Ensure transparency by publishing annual financial summaries.  

**Authority**  
- Governing Board has authority over financial decisions only.  
- The Board does not make binding technical decisions.  
- Influence over technical direction is exercised through negotiation with the Steering Committee and via funding priorities.

## 2. Steering Committee

**Composition**  
- Majority Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet committers.  
- Limited sponsor representation permitted (no more than one voting seat per company).  
- Members elected or appointed for fixed terms to ensure diversity of perspective.  

**Responsibilities**  
- Define high-level technical priorities for Arrow and Parquet.  
- Translate Governing Board funding allocations into actionable technical initiatives.  
- Provide a single, authoritative channel of direction to the Engineering Team.  
- Ensure all Arctos activities remain compatible with the culture of open source communities.  
- Publish annual technical direction statements or roadmaps.  

**Authority**  
- The Steering Committee has sole authority over technical direction.  
- It negotiates with the Governing Board to balance sponsor priorities with community needs.  
- It alone communicates project direction to the Engineering Team.

## 3. Engineering Team

**Composition**  
- Paid fellows, contractors, and community contributors supported through Arctos.  
- Contributors are encouraged and will very likely participate in the broader Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet ecosystems.  

**Responsibilities**  
- Implement technical priorities as communicated by the Steering Committee.  
- Maintain project health: issue triage, release management, CI/CD, documentation, and infrastructure.  
- Provide feedback to the Steering Committee on feasibility, timelines, and resourcing needs.  

**Authority**  
- The Engineering Team has day-to-day autonomy in how to implement work.  
- Engineers take strategic direction only from the Steering Committee, not directly from sponsors or the Governing Board.  
- While not bound by Apache Software Foundation rules, Arctos engineering work is expected to align with the collaborative, meritocratic culture common to successful open source projects, and to respect the governance of adjacent projects (e.g., Arrow, Parquet).

## 4. Interaction Model

- **Governing Board ↔ Steering Committee**: Negotiation forum. The Board defines funding priorities; the SC ensures those priorities align with technical needs.  
- **Steering Committee → Engineering Team**: Single authoritative channel of direction. Engineers receive clarity without competing or conflicting instructions.  
- **Engineering Team ↔ Steering Committee**: Feedback loop. Engineers inform SC of feasibility and constraints; SC adjusts direction accordingly.

## 5. Transparency & Accountability

- The Governing Board and Steering Committee publish annual reports summarizing:  
  - Financial allocations and sponsorships.  
  - Funded contributors and major initiatives.  
  - Technical priorities and achievements.  
- Meeting notes (excluding sensitive HR/contract details) are made public.
