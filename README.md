# Arctos Alliance Governance

Welcome to the governance repository for the **Arctos Alliance**.  
This repository contains documents that define how the Alliance is structured and how it operates.

## Purpose

Arctos Alliance was created to support the sustainability and independence of the Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet ecosystems.  
Our governance model ensures:
- **Sponsors** have a clear voice through financial contributions.  
- **Community committers** have authority over technical direction.  
- **Engineers** have a single, clear channel of direction.
